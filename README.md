# AES Image Encryption and Decryption
Securely encrypt and decrypt images using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This repository provides a Python script to perform AES encryption and decryption on image files, ensuring data security and integrity.

## Features

- Encrypt images using AES encryption.
- Decrypt AES-encrypted images.
- Safeguard your image data with strong encryption.
- Verify data integrity with authentication tags.
- Easy-to-follow Python script for image encryption and decryption.


Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `pycryptodome` library. You can install it using `pip`:

  ```bash
  pip install pycryptodome

Installation

Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/wizzysss/AES-Image-Encryption.git

Change the working directory to the project folder:

    cd AES-Image-Encryption

Usage

Place the image you want to encrypt in the project directory with the name kermit.png, or modify the script to specify your image file.

Run the Python script to perform encryption and decryption:

bash

    python ImageEncryption.py
      
The encrypted image will be saved as encrypted_image.bin, and the decrypted image as decrypted_kermit.png.

Customize the code for your own image and security requirements as needed.
